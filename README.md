# My Blog Site

I'm fed up with the complexity of [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) while still short of flexibility. They all define their own [front-matters](https://www.google.com/search?q=frontmatter) as metadata which makes it very diffcult to port from one to another.

After a night of experiment with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), I failed to figure out a smooth way to transit my old [Jekyll site](https://github.com/manuzhang/manuzhang.github.io) to them. Maybe I'm the one to blame, since most of my experiences have been in backend with Java and Scala. Anyway, I'm done with it and from now on I'll write and host my blog posts here in purely markdown. I'll cross-post them to [medium](https://medium.com/@manuzhang) and other interfaces.

The old site is archived and I've copied all the posts here as they were. Meanwhile, they will always be available at https://manuzhang.github.io.
